## Sensors

### VisionClient aka Eyes üëÄ

You can write an application that wants to play with camera feed. The camera is assumed to be regular USB webcam.
They application will be able to read the last frame the camera has seen. 

```bash
from sensors.vision.client import VisionClient

# Initialize client
client = VisionClient()

# 1. Read the latest frame
frame_id, image = client.read()

# 2. Process the image and do something fun

# 3. If you want to ‚Äúremember‚Äù this frame, mark it persistent
client.mark_persistent(frame_id, meta={'memory': 'Saw something amazing!'})
```

## Development related stuff
To keep code synced between your machine and the Pi, place the following in file called `sync.sh`
```bash
rsync -avz --delete --exclude ".venv/" --exclude "__pycache__/" ./  pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi/chakna/
```

and then do
```bash
$ chmod +x sync.sh
$ ./sync.sh
```
